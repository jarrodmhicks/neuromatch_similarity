# Neuromatch Similarity

This repository contains code for the Neuromatch Academy Deep Learning summer course project attempting to predict human similarity judgments from neural network representations.

The project is mainly an exercise to replicate findings from "[Human Alignment of neural network representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01201)" by re-implementing several basic analyses.
